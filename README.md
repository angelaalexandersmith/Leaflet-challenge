### Leaflet-Challenge

The first task was to visualise an earthquake dataset. 

Dataset was obtained from the USGS to obtain a GeoJSON which was then imported and using Leaflet a map was created to plot all the Earthquakes from the Dataset based on their longitude and latitude visualised as per the below image:

A second dataset was then plotted on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. This Dataset on tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates

The following tasks were then performed:

The tectonic plates were visulised on the map in addition to the earthquakes, these were placed as seperate views and layer controls added to produce the visulisation below:
